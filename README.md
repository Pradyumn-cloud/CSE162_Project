# 📄 Plagiarism Detector

A simple yet efficient **Plagiarism Detection Tool** that uses the **Rabin-Karp Algorithm** to identify similar or copied content between multiple documents. Built for educational and lightweight use cases such as code plagiarism or text analysis.

## 🔍 How It Works

This project uses the **Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm**, which applies hashing to efficiently search for matching substrings between documents. It’s especially useful for detecting plagiarism in a set of files by comparing rolling hashes of text chunks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Detects plagiarism between two or more text documents.
- 🧠 Utilizes the Rabin-Karp algorithm for fast and reliable pattern matching.
- 📊 Outputs similarity percentage and highlights matching content.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:**  JavaScript / CSS / HTML
- **Algorithm:** Rabin-Karp String Matching
- **Backend (optional):** Node.js / Express.js
